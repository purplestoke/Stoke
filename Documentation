This Documentation describes the Methods used in the Stoke.py Class Object. Stoke is a Discord bot which hosts online gaming events
using the Ethereum blockchain. Stoke does not write anything to the blockchain, the bot only queries the blockchain in order
to verify payments made to the bugs Wallets. By doing so Stoke can identify individuals over the internet without the need for
identifying information. 

Stoke reads and writes from a SQL database which holds all public information needed to create a bugs and player profiles.
This includes a users; Discord id, Eth address and gamertag

Other information in the Database is; tx hashes, guild ids, role ids, channel ids, event flags, payment flags, rate tables

As a result of this structure all a user needs in order to compete in bugs Events is an Eth wallet (Non-Hosted) 
and Discord account.

FLAGS
Flags are spit out from methods of the Stoke Class object. These Flags are recorded in the Logs directory. 
A Flag of 3 is most likely an SQL Error, however it could also be an error of some other library used by Stoke. 

1 = Method Error
2 = Success
3 = Database Error 
4 = Arg Error 
5 = Malicious Intent

Stoke.bugsProfile: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The bugsProfile class leads to more methods which allow for the ability to create, delete, 
  retrieve, or validate a bugs Profile. Another sub-method allows for the retrieval of a bugs Id.
  
  __init__(discord, ethAddr)  

  .hasProfile() ----------
  _discord
    Takes argument of the users discord id and verifies that the user has created a bugs Profile
    If profile found the method returns a Flag of 2, Else a Flag of 1 is returned

  .create() ----------
  _discord
  _ethAddr

    Takes argument(s) of the users Discord id and and input of the users Eth Address. This method makes
    an Etherscan API call and searches for a 0.003 ETH transaction made to the bugs Treasury Wallet. The params 
    used for the query is the range of blocks from, the first block generated at 12:00 AM + 8500 blocks. These block
    numbers are found using the getBlockNums() method in the Functions class. If the payment is made within 
    that period and this method is called within that period the transaction will be verified.

    This method returns a flag of 2 if the profile is created. This inserts the users Discord Id, Eth address,
    and the Tx hash into the bugs Database.
    If a flag of 5 is returned it means that duplicate information is attempting to be inserted into the database.
    Either the Eth address has already been used, or the Discord account already has a profile. 

  .delete() ----------
  _discord

    Takes argument(s) of the users Discord id which is used to delete all player and bugs profiles, lastly 
    it fetches all role ids.

    Returns a flag of 2 and a list of the role ids if successful.
    If not successful, returns a flag of 3 and an empty list. 

  .retrieve() ----------
  _discord

    Takes the argument of the users Discord id. And queries the bugs Database for the Eth address associated.
    Returns a Flag of 2 and the Ethereum Address. If Error returns a Flag of 3. 
    
  .update(_discord, _ethAddr) ----------

    Takes the argument(s) of the users Discord id and the New Etheruem address they want to now use for their
    bugs Profile. This method makes an Etherscan API call using the new address and searches for a Eth tx of 
    0.003 ETH to the bugs Treasury wallet within the first Block generated that day at 12:00 AM + 8500 blocks.
    If the payment is sent and the method is called within that range of blocks the method will return a Flag of 2.

    A flag of 5 is returned if the Eth address is already found in the database. 

  .bugsId(_discord) ----------

    Takes the argument of the users Discord id. Uses that id and queries the bugs Database for the users bugsId.
    Returns a Flag of 2 and the users bugsId if executed properly. Otherwise a Flag of 3 and a bugsId of None is returned.  

Stoke.Guilds() -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Stoke.Guilds() method leads to a group of methods for pulling guild information such as channel ids, role ids,
  community scores in events and player scores. 

  __init__(find, guildId) ----------

  .pullChannel() ----------
  _id
  _find

    Takes the argument(s) of _id and find. "find" is a string of a Discord Channel created by the Stoke bot.
    This arg filters which channel id Stoke will pull from the database. The _id arg is the guild id where this method
    takes place. So channels within that specific guild are pulled. 

    If successful the method returns the channel id and a Flag of 2. 
    A Flag of 3 means there was an error with the SQL query.

  .pullName() ----------
  _id

    Takes arg of guild Id and pulls the Server name 
    Returns Server name as a String
    If unsuccessful returns a Flag of 3

  .pullId() ----------
  _id

    Takes arg of guild Id and pulls the bugs id of that server
    Returns as a Integer
    If unsuccessful returns a Flag of 3

  .pullScore() ----------
  _id

    Takes arg of guild Id and pulls the Server's score in an Event
    Returns score
    If unsuccessful returns a Flag of 3

  .pullRole() ----------
  _guildId 
  _find

    Takes argument(s) of guildId and find. This method returns the role id for a bugs role within the server specified
    by the guild id. Find is a string of the role for which we want to get the role id. 
    Returns a Flag of 2 and the role id.
    If unsuccessfull returns a Flag of 3 and a empty string.
    If a flag of 4 is returned then something went wrong with the "find" param.  

Stoke.PlayerProfile() -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Stoke.PlayerProfile() method leads to a group of methods for creating, deleting, and retrieving a
  player profile. 

  __init__(discord, guildId, type) ----------

  .create() ----------
  _discord
  _gamertag
  _guildId 
  _type

    Takes argument(s) discord, gamertag, guildId and type. (type referes to the type of game, apex, finals...)
    This method creates a player profile. A player profile is linked to a users bugs Profile. Users of bugs can create
    a player profile for each game bugs supports. These profiles contain the users gamertag and the Discord server/community
    they will represent in the game. The community a user represents is dependent on which Discord Server the user creates a
    player profile. 

    If successful this method will return a Flag of 2
    A Flag of 3 means either 
    the user does not have a bugs Profile or 
    an error occured when attempting to fetch the users bugs id or
    an error occured when attempting to pull the Servers guild id 
    A Flag of 4 means an issues with the "_type" param
    A Flag of 5 means a duplicate gamertag is attempting to be used
    
  .delete() ----------
  _discord
  _type

    Takes argument(s) of the users Discord id and which player profile they are deleting.
    Deletes a users player profile not their bugs profile. 

    If successful returns a Flag of 2
    Flag 3 means error when inserting None into Database
    Flag 4 means _type error 

  .retrieve() ----------
  _discord 
  _type

    Takes argument(s) of the users discord id and the type of profile they are retrieving (Apex ^ Xdef ^ Finals). Pulls users
    gamertag for that player profile. 

    If successfull returns a Flag of 2 and the users gamertag
    Flag 3 means an error occured when retrieving the information
    Flag 4 means _type error

    .pullPoints() ----------
    _discord
    _type

    Takes argument(s) discord and type. This method pull the users points in an event from the database
    based on the type arg.

  deleting submissions. 

  __init__(discord, game) ----------

  .isOn(event) ----------

  .pmntFlag(flag) ----------
    _game

    Takes argument(s) of game and flag. This method sets the payment flag which allows the Stoke bot to verify payments
    for events. If flag is set to 0 Stoke will not verify payments for the game in which the flag is off.
